This is a program to show the proof of concept, via excel links. 

Idea is to create a psuedo client/server relationship, this is for the benefit of moving to RESTful based system in the future. 

Each Quote File acts as a client, and send their information and pull information from the central server, which is just another excel file. 

There is no hosting set up for this, an actual implementation would require a CI application. 

Goal would be eventually to have this hosted in a SQL database, but for now this will do.

Having it show public considering there's no company information, and I want to fill out my page a little more.
